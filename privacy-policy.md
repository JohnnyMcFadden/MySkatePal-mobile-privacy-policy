SkateDex: Privacy policy

Welcome to the SkateDex app!

This is app is developed by https://www.thejoecodes.com/.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information outside of user signup. Signing up is completely optional and only collects your email address. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Jonathan McFadden
